## Usage

In theory, I am a member of a marketing agency who wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the Horiseon site is optimized for search engines. And having more efficient code for Horiseon's website looks good for drawing in potential employees and revenue.

## Credits

Aside from my instructor and TA, I pulled bits of code and information from w3schools.com.

## License

None.
